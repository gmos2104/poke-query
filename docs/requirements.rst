- Define two endpoints:

  ``/ GET`` List of Pokémons.

    Params:

    - `q`: narrow results by name

    - `offset` and `limit` to control the results returned

  ``/<name>`` Pokémon information.

- Use Python. Optional with any framework of choice

- Get the data from `PokéApi <https://pokeapi.co>`_

- Pokémon search should allow partial names (e.g: pika)

- Linters / Testing are nice to have

- Propose an enhancement plan for the API's

See `Notes <notes.rst>`_ for explanations on some of these points.
