Possible Enhancements
#####################

- Allow search of pokÃ©mons by type. Is common that you want to know which pokÃ©mon can counter a certain type.

- Improve search query to specify if the search starts or ends with the given query. Kinda like ``%`` in some SQL Engines.

  Some Examples:

  - ``rat% -> ['rattata', 'raticate']``

  - ``%saur -> ['bulbasaur', 'ivysaur', 'venusaur']``
